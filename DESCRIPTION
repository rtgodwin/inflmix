Title: Estimates the One-Inflated Positive Poisson Mixture Model (OIPPMM)

Description: Estimates the parameters of the one-inflated positive Poisson
    model (OIPPMM) using an EM algorithm. If no starting values are provided,
    it begins with a grid search over two mixture components, and then runs an
    EM algorithm. The process is repeated with an additional mixture component 
    until the non-parametric MLE is found (i.e. until the addition of a
    component yields no improvement in the likelihood function). It also
    generates OIPPMM variates, and calculates Horvitz-Thompson population size
    estimates.
